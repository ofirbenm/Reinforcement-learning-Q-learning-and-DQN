# Reinforcement-learning-Q-learning-and-DQN
In this assignment i will get to know and experiment with OpenAI Gym, a testbed for reinforcement learning algorithms containing environments in different difficulty levels.
I will implement 2 algorithms:
1. tabular Q-learning model on a simple environment.
2. Neural Network function approximator of the Q-value, using the basic DQN algorithm.
